			<h2 class='onlyOne'>1.30 (November 16, 2021)</h2>
			<ul class ='onlyOne'>
				<li>Korean and Taiwanese versions of NSMBW are now supported (this means the game now supports all Wii releases of NSMBW!)</li>
				<li>An issue with the replay recorder that prevented it from functioning has been fixed.</li>
				<li>The save file is now stored in Wii NAND (instead of external storage) by default to work around a Riivolution bug.</li>
				<li>The game's files are now compressed with LZ instead of LH; slightly larger filesize, but easier to mod.</li>
				<li>Starting a new save and getting to the World 8 map in one sitting no longer crashes the game.</li>
				<li>The hard mode cheat code no longer uses the B button, because it didn't work with the nunchuk.</li>
				<li>The message that appears after activating hard mode was slightly adjusted to be more natural.</li>
				<li>Certain world map transitions were removed to cut down on waiting and loading.</li>
				<li>The ground in World 9's map was extended to address another bug that has not yet been properly fixed.</li>
				<li>Instead of message box text being spaced manually (and poorly), all text is now centered automatically.</li>
				<li>Some message box messages were touched up.</li>
				<li>Several improvements throughout the game to tiling, object placements, entrance positions, etc.</li>
				<li>Some extra coins in a couple levels are now affected by POW blocks.</li>
				<li>Trampoline blocks alternate correctly now, with the same pattern as the vanilla game.</li>
				<li>In 3-Tower, the pipe before the boss room was enterable by mistake, which caused strange behaviour. This was fixed.</li>
				<li>The texture of the flag in 4-Tower was changed to the standard Japanese flag.</li>
				<li>You can no longer reach the top of the boss room with a propeller suit and get stuck during the World 4 boss fight.</li>
				<li>Yoshi can no longer eat icicle platforms. In addition, he has been restored to 5-2 (he was removed in 1.20 because of this bug).</li>
				<li>The airship rocking effect was removed from the vertical bonus room in 7-6.</li>
				<li>The ground animation was reversed during the train level so it scrolls in the correct direction.</li>
				<li>Fixed spawning of parabeetles at the end of C-3 so they don't incorrectly clump together.</li>
				<li>A switch in 9-6 was made re-pressable, so you don't get stuck when the timer runs out.</li>
				<li>Credits updated to include more recent usernames and some of the people who helped with this update.</li>
				<li>The credits flipbook images were retaken.</li>
			</ul>
